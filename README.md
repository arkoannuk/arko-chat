## Introduction
This project is a simple chat room app, where users can register, log in, and exchange messages in real time.

## Purpose
I built this project to see how Firebase can be integrated with the Vue.js framework. By incorporating Firebase Authentication and Firestore, I got to create a real-time interactive application with secure user management and dynamic data synchronization capabilities. It also helped me solidify fundemental Vue concepts such as data binding, directives, and life cycle hooks. 

## Features
- User authentication and authorization with Firebase Authentication
- Real-time data synchronization and management using Firebase Firestore
- Easy-to-use interface for chat interactions and user management.
- Responsive design to ensure smooth functionality across various devices

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- Vue.js
- Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
